I've implemented the airpot challenge for airpot capacity of 50 planes.

what important for me to check was that :

* 50 planes can land in the airport
* The 51st plane can't land in the airpot
* The airpot can take off only planes in the airport
* planes can land and take off only if the weather is sunny
